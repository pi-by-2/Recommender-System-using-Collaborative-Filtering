# Recommender-System-using-Collaborative-Filtering
With the advent of online shopping and streaming sites, recommender system has become a crucial part of business. Everytime, you look for a product in Amazon, a list of suggestions appear based on past history of the user. Netflix gives similar experience with their shows. In fact for a 10% improved accuracy in their recommender system, they awarded the winning team of an open online contest with 1 million dollar.

For training the dataset, we have used SURPRISE library that is built specially for recommender system. Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD), K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN), and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) are used to train the models and RMSE and MAE scores are used as metrics for evaluation.

The final report is linked in the repository.
